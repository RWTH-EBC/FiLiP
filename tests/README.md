How to run tests
================
We use Python's `unittest` framework for implementing our tests, with Continuous Integration (CI) set up to automate the testing process.
While CI ensures all tests are run automatically, it may take some time to complete.
For quicker feedback during development, we recommend that developers run tests locally.

To run the tests locally, follow these simple steps:

1. clone the repo
2. prepare `.env` file from the `TEMPLATE_ENV`
3. Put the file under this folder, i.e., "tests"
4. Run tests in the development environment of your choice
