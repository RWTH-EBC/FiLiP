# ## Parameters
#
# To run this example you need a working Fiware v2 setup with a
# context-broker, an IoT-Agent and mqtt-broker. You can here set the
# addresses:
#
# Host address of Context Broker
CB_URL = "http://localhost:1026"
# Host address of IoT-Agent
IOTA_URL = "http://localhost:4041"
# Host address of the MQTT-Broker
MQTT_BROKER_URL = "mqtt://localhost:1883"

# You can here also change the used Fiware service
# FIWARE-Service
SERVICE = 'filip'
# FIWARE-Servicepath
SERVICE_PATH = '/example'

# You may also change the ApiKey Information
# ApiKey of the Device
DEVICE_APIKEY = 'filip-example-device'
# ApiKey of the ServiceGroup
SERVICE_GROUP_APIKEY= 'filip-example-service-group'
