# ## Parameters
#
# To run this example you need a working Fiware v2 setup with a
# context-broker, an IoT-Agent and mqtt-broker. Here you can set the
# addresses:
#
# Host address of Context Broker
CB_URL = settings.CB_URL
# Host address of IoT-Agent
IOTA_URL = settings.IOTA_URL
# Host address of the MQTT-Broker
MQTT_BROKER_URL = str(settings.MQTT_BROKER_URL)

# Here you can also change the used Fiware service
# FIWARE-Service
SERVICE = 'filip'
# FIWARE-Service path
SERVICE_PATH = '/example'

# You may also change the ApiKey Information
# ApiKey of the Device
DEVICE_APIKEY = 'filip-example-device'
# ApiKey of the ServiceGroup
SERVICE_GROUP_APIKEY = 'filip-example-service-group'
