# therefore reuses the streams of the root logger.

# setting up the basic configuration of the logging system. Please check the
# official documentation and the functions docstrings for more details.
# Handling for 'handlers' in the logging system is not trivial.
# It is also import to know that this function should only be called once in
# your application. Since FiLiP is an SDK that should help to implement other
# services we do not call this function anywhere in our code.
# Hence, it is up to the user to configure the logging system.

# In this example we will simply change the log level and the log format.
