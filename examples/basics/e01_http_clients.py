    # First a create a fiware header that you want to work with
    # For more details on the headers check the official documentation:
    # https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/multitenancy/index.html
    #
    # In short a fiware header specifies a location in Fiware where the
    # created entities will be saved and requests are executed.
    # It can be thought of as a separated subdirectory where you work in.

    # # 2 Client modes
    # You can run the clients in different modes:
    #
    # ## 2.1 Run it as pure python object.
    #
    # This will open and close a connection each time you use a function.
    cb_client = ContextBrokerClient(url="http://134.130.166.184:1026",

    print(f"OCB Version: {cb_client.get_version()}")

    # ## 2.2 Run the client via the python's context protocol.
    #
    # This will initialize requests.session that the client will reuse for
    # each function.
    # Formally, this usually lead to an performance boost because the
    # connection was reused reused. The client and its connection will be
    # closed after the end of the with-statement. However, thanks to urllib3
    # the keep-alive and session reuse is handled totally automatically.
    with ContextBrokerClient(fiware_header=fiware_header) as cb_client:
        print(f"OCB Version: {cb_client.get_version()}")

    # ## 2.3 Run the client with an externally provided requests.Session object
    #
    # This mode is recommend when you want to reuse requests.Session and mix
    # different clients. It is also useful in combination with OAuth2Session
    # objects that handle authentication mechanisms and third party libraries.
    # Please be aware that you need to do the session handling yourself.
    # Hence, always create the session by using python's context protocol or
    # manually close the connection.
    with requests.Session() as s:
        cb_client = ContextBrokerClient(session=s, fiware_header=fiware_header)
        print(f"OCB Version: {cb_client.get_version()}")

    # # 3 Version information
    #
    # Independent of the selected mode, the version of the client can always be
    # accessed as follows:
    iota_client = IoTAClient(fiware_header=fiware_header)
    print(f"Iot-Agent Version: {iota_client.get_version()}")
    ql_client = QuantumLeapClient(fiware_header=fiware_header)
    print(f"QuantumLeap Version: {ql_client.get_version()}")

    # # 4 URL
    #
    # Additional to the FiwareHeader each client needs an URL, that points
    # to the Fiware-server.
    #
    # ## 4.1 Environment variables
    #
    # As shown above the client does not need to be given explicitly. If no URL
    # is given to the client, it is extracted from the environment variables
    #
    # ## 4.2 Direct Provision
    #
    # Instead of using an .env.filip or environment variables you can also
    # provide the url directly to the specific clients. It also takes any
    # additional keyword arguments a requests.request would also take,
    # e.g. headers, params etc.

    # # 5 Combined Client
    #
    # The library also contains a client (HttpClient) that contains all the
    # particular clients as bundle.
    # It works almost the same as the other agents but takes a config. This
    # can be either a dict or the path to a json file:
