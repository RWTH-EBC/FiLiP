# Tutorial NGSI v2

The tutorial NGSI v2 will teach you how you can build your own smart solutions by means of a cloud based heating control using FIWARE as central data integration platform.

You will find all files [here](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/FiLiP/tree/master/tutorials/ngsi_v2).

Before starting you need to install the requirements from this directory:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Each of the exercises will teach on basic concept required for semantic IoT 
systems. 
In each exercise you will find a description of the steps needed.
If your cannot accomplish an exercise you might check the provided solutions.

The exercises build up from one to the other.
Therefore, you need to work on them in the right order.

The concepts are generally transferable to your personal use cases.

**Note:** So far we only cover the basic concepts of NGSIv2 here. For advanced 
usage and the integration of ontologies we refer to our [examples](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/FiLiP/tree/master/examples).
