# Exercise 7: Semantic IoT Systems
We now want to add a semantic meaning to our measurements. Therefore we
semantically connect to the context entities that we created in
`e3_context_entities.py`

The input sections are marked with 'ToDo'

#### Steps to complete:
1. Set up the missing parameters in the parameter section
2. Add relationships that connect the weather station to the building,
   and vice versa
3. Add relationships that connect the thermal zone temperature sensor and
   the heater to the building, and vice versa
4. Retrieve all entities and print them
5. Congratulations you are now ready to build your own semantic systems for
   advanced semantic functions check on our semantics examples
