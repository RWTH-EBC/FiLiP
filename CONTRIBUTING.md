# Contribute as a user

The documentation, examples and tutorials should be understandable and the code bug-free.
As all user's have different backgrounds, you may not understand everything or encounter bugs.
In that case, PLEASE raise an issue [here](https://github. com/RWTH-EBC/filip/issues/new).

Consider labeling the issue using the flag `bug` or `documentation` / `question`.

# Contribute as a developer

If you instead want to contribute new features or fix bugs yourself, we are more than happy.

Please also [raise an issue](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/filip/issues/new) 
create a new branch labeled `XY_some_name`.
Here, `XY` is the number of your issue and `some_name` is a meaningful 
description.
Alternatively and preferred, issue branches are created automatically on issue 
assignment with [robvanderleek/create-issue-branch](https://github.com/robvanderleek/create-issue-branch).

See [workflow definition](.github/workflows/issue-tracker.yml) and 
[configuration file](.github/issue-branch.yml) for customization.

Branch creation is skipped for issues with label "question".

Once you're feature is ready, create a pull request and check if the pipeline succeeds.
Assign a reviewer before merging. 
Once review is finished, you can merge.

**Before** implementing or modifying modules, classes or functions, please read the following page.

## Styleguide

We use PEP8 as a styleguide. Some IDEs (like PyCharm) automatically show you code that is not in PEP8. If you don't have such an IDE, please read [this page](https://pep8.org/) to get a better understanding of it.

## Documentation

All created or modified function should be documented properly. 
Try to follow the structure already present. 
If possible, write a little doctest example into the docstring to make clear to user's what the desired output of your function is. 
All non-self-explanatory lines of code should include a comment. 
Although you will notice that not all docstring are already in this style we use the google-style for docstrings, e.g.

```python

from typing import Union

def foo(dummy: str , dummy2: Union[str, int]):
    """
    Describe what the function does in here.
    The blank line below is necessary for the doc to render nicely.
    
    Args:
        dummy (str): Any parameter description
        dummy (str, int): A variable that may have two types.
    """
```

Furthermore, we use type annotations as this helps users to automatically 
identify wrong usage of functions. 
In a further step type annotations may also help to accelerate your code. 
For further details please check the official [documentation on type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

## Unit-Tests
Espacially when creating new functions or classes, you have to add a unit-test function.
Open the `test_module.py` file in the `\tests`-directory and add a function to the class `TestModule`with a name like `test_my_new_function`. If you create a new module, you have to create a new `test_my_new_module.py` file and follow the existing structure of the 
other test-files.

If you are not familiar with unit-tests, here is a quick summary:
- Test as many things as possible. Even seemingly silly tests like correct input-format help prevent future problems for new users
- use the `self.assertSOMETHING` functions provided by `unittest`. This way a test failure is presented correctly An error inside your test function will not be handeled as a failure but an error.
- If the success of your test depends on the used device, you can use decorators like `skip()`, `skipif(numpy.__version__<(1, 0), "not supported with your numpy version")`, etc. 
- `setUp()` and `tearDown()` are called before and after each test. Use this functions to define parameters used in every test, or to close applications like Dymola once a test is completed.
- See the [unittest-documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#organizing-tests) for further information

You can check your work by running all tests before commiting to git. 

## Pylint
With pylint we try to keep our code clean.  
See the description in [this repo](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/EBC/EBC_all/gitlab_ci/templates/tree/master/pylint) on information on what pylint is and how to use it.
