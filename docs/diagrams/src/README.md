## Scan project architecture

To regenerate the diagrams for the project architecture, please execute ``update_architecture.py``, which will generate the PlantUML text in the `architecture.puml` file.

```bash
python update_architecture.py
```

After that, you can use the [PlantUML Web Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/) to generate the diagrams.
