Welcome to FiLiP's documentation!
=======================================

**FiLiP** stands for: **FI**\WARE **Li**\brary for **P**\ython


Installation
-------------------

For installation use pip. Run ``pip install -e "Path/to/this/repository"``

If environment variables are not set properly, try more explicit command in Windows shell:

``C:\Path\to\pythonDirectory\python.exe -c "import pip" & C:\Path\to\pythonDirectory\python.exe -m pip install -e C:\Path\to\this\repository``

Be aware of forward slashes (for python) and backslashes (for Windows). You might need to encompass paths in inverted commas (") in order to handle spaces.
