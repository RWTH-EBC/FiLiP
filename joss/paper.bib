	abstract = {In this work, an open source platform, based on the {FIWARE} software framework and other open source components, is used to perform experimental cloud control on two use cases from the smart building and smart grid domains. All communication between the platform and the field layer is realized via the public internet and therefore encryption, authentication, and authorization measures are installed. In the first use case, the supply temperature of a conventional heating circuit is controlled as it is a common task in building energy systems. In the second use case, the power balance of a simulated microgrid is monitored by real phasor measurement units and a controller is used to maintain grid stabilty. The suitability of the platform is validated using requirements derived from literature. The platform is applicable to both use cases. Though, limitations and prospective areas for improvement are identified.},
